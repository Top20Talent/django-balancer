Django-Balancer was created by Brandon Konkle.  It was inspired by the example
in the Django docs, a post on Eli Bendersky's blog [1], and Jeff Balogh's
django-multidb-router project.  Much of the pinning and round-robin code was
taken from Jeff Balogh's project and modified.

In July of 2015, development of this library was taken over by Mike Helmick.
